Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A: We use remote repository when our project is hosted somewhere on cloud rather than on local machine.
    So in order to sync the repository hosted on could with our local machine we use remote repository.

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A: Since, there might be case when I want to have different progress on local machine and on GitHub which wont be possible if it syncs automatically
